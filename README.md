# Strengths

- Understand product problem domains and select technologies aligned with business context
- Build maintainable and extensible systems through testing and sound design
- Rapidly learn unfamiliar technologies
- Team building using Agile (Scrum)
- Full-stack web development across frontend, backend, and infrastructure
- Cross‑platform mobile development with React Native (Expo)
- Clear, scalable asynchronous communication and process design
- Applied AI: LLM apps, RAG, AI agents, tool use/function calling, structured outputs
- Real‑time and multimodal UX: streaming UI, TTS/STT, low‑latency pipelines, edge inference

I have led many greenfield and large-scale replacement projects to solve issues in existing systems.

I propose and execute optimal system architectures based on current constraints and goals.

I highly value psychological safety for teams/organizations, aiming for consistently respectful and flat communication.

Recently, I call myself a Product Engineer: I prioritize the product first and choose the technologies and approaches that best serve it.

# Areas I'm less strong in

- Web design (I can write CSS, but I am not a UI/UX designer)
- Development where the background/objectives are unclear and the work is just “do as told”

# Engineering Principles I Emphasize

Below is what I focus on across frontend, backend, and cloud (infrastructure).

### As a Frontend Engineer

My recent stack centers around Next.js, React, and React Native (Expo).

- Real‑time/multimodal UI for AI: WebRTC, SSE/streaming responses, audio capture/playback, transcript rendering
- Safety/guardrails surfaced in UX (disclaimers, PII redaction prompts, feedback loops)
- Separate pure, props-only components from those with side effects
- Invest mainly in two forms of testing:
  - Storybook-driven tests
  - E2E tests (essential to ensure frontend behavior)
- Use snapshot and unit tests for functions where appropriate

With Storybook, I strive to represent all component behaviors there, and deploy static Storybook outputs for easy review. Recently, I have been using Chromatic:

https://github.com/tetratensor/Timelogger-Frontend

This significantly improves UI review efficiency. Though it takes time, it consistently streamlines UI communication.

I design for portability to non-Node.js runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Edge Runtime.

With React Server Components (via Next.js), I carefully balance Server Components and Client Components.
I also design for streaming-first UIs for AI inference (progressive rendering, optimistic UI).

### As a Backend Engineer

Recently, due to my focus on Generative AI, I primarily write Python. I prefer starting small with lightweight frameworks like FastAPI. I usually adopt a layered architecture with DDD-inspired design to keep code testable and evolvable.

- Always test the application/use-case layer
- For database tests, I prefer using a real test database rather than heavy mocking (while keeping the code mockable). Verifying actual data persistence is a critical factor for backend APIs.
- Because DB-backed tests can be slow, I also apply performance improvements for test execution.

The largest scale I have handled in performance work:

- ~20 million members
- Throughput goal: 5,000 rps
- Target: <150 ms response for read APIs under the above load

I mostly run on cloud/serverless. In performance testing, I verify that scaling out improves performance accordingly.

AI backend focus:

- RAG pipelines (chunking, embeddings, hybrid/semantic search, reranking)
- Tool use/function calling, JSON/JSON Schema structured outputs
- Agent patterns (routing, planning, state persistence)
- Async streaming (Server‑Sent Events), WebRTC relays, low‑latency audio TTS/STT

Reference personal project using Generative AI (Python + FastAPI):

https://github.com/tetratensor/AI-Cat-Persona-API

### As a Cloud Engineer

While not a dedicated SRE, I have designed AWS networking from scratch for a ~1M-user service replacement project.

For startups, I often prefer high-performance serverless platforms like Cloudflare Workers or simple container platforms like Fly.io to minimize infra maintenance and focus on application development. For databases, I favor DBaaS such as PlanetScale; features like branching and safe migrations significantly improve DX.
For AI workloads, I also leverage serverless GPU (Modal) and managed inference (Cloud Run) with streaming endpoints.

For larger-scale systems, AWS often remains the best option in terms of cost and available knowledge.

I manage AWS resources with Terraform to capture who changed what/when and to codify environment setup.

I follow AWS best practices such as the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/index.ja.html) with strong attention to security.

## Skill Levels

Self-assessed proficiency scale:

My longest experience is with JavaScript/TypeScript, and I keep up with the latest standards.

PHP: used for ~4 years early in my career; knowledge is dated (around 7.3).

Recently, I most often write TypeScript and Go for frontend with React/Next.js and infra code for AWS Lambda. Ruby proficiency is decent but outdated. Java/Scala experience is limited.

I am frequently involved in development for LLM-backed applications. Python is mainly used on the backend.

### Frameworks (Backend)

| Name             | Level | Notes                                               |
| ---------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Laravel          | A     | Introduced from scratch; last PHP project used this |
| Express          | S     | Frequently used from 2019 for Node.js on server     |
| NestJS           | A     | Frequently used from 2022 for Node.js on server     |

| Hono             | A     | Used in personal projects                           |

### AI/ML SDKs & Services

| Name                   | Level | Notes                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI API/SDK         | S     | Chat, tools, Realtime API, embeddings |
| Anthropic (Claude) API | A     | Tools, reasoning, safety              |
| Google Gemini API      | A     | Multimodal Live, images/audio/video   |
| Modal (serverless GPU) | A     | Batch/streaming inference jobs        |
| Milvus (Zilliz Cloud)  | B     | Vector search for RAG                 |
| Pinecone               | B     | Evaluating serverless                 |

Current thinking: rather than full-stack monolith frameworks, I often favor thin frameworks like [Hono](https://hono.dev/) with Cloudflare Workers to build small, loosely coupled systems, because:

- Next.js shifts more application logic into the frontend (LLM apps aside)
- Cloud services and libraries have reduced backend code amounts

Of course, monoliths can be the faster path in many cases; it depends.

With Go, I typically avoid frameworks and build small container apps with the standard library.

For TypeScript, I consider Edge runtimes like Cloudflare Workers first, and even on Node.js I aim for designs portable to non-Node runtimes.

### Frameworks/Libraries (Frontend)

| Name         | Level | Notes                                                     |
| ------------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| jQuery       | A     | Used early in career; no longer used recently             |
| React        | S     | Using since ~2018; track best practices                   |
| React Native | A     | Cross‑platform apps with Expo; native modules when needed |
| Vue.js       | B     | Built SPA incl. Vuex; less proficient than React          |
| Next.js      | S     | Used for multiple greenfield apps                         |
| Nuxt.js      | A     | Used for multiple greenfield apps                         |
| Angular      | B     | Studied v16 era; not used recently                        |

Comfortable with npm-based frontend tooling. Recently, my main is Next.js (React). I used Redux often before but now also use SWR and React Context, and like simple state libs such as [valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio).

Newer frameworks like Svelte/Solid/Qwik are interesting, but I currently prefer React for its ecosystem maturity, stability, and wealth of information. Many innovations (e.g., Server Components) emerge from the React ecosystem.

### RDB

| Name      | Level | Notes                                       |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| MySQL     | A     | Heavily used from 5.1 to 5.7                |
| Redis     | A     | Built Redis Sentinel-based failover on-prem |
| memcached | A     | Used as cache in early career               |
| MongoDB   | B     | Used once for internal system               |
| DynamoDB  | B     | Used for auth in a serverless API           |

I handled introduction-to-tuning for all the above. MongoDB usage was limited and not under high load. I care deeply about MySQL schema and performance. Recently I prefer DBaaS like PlanetScale for cost and DX (branching, safe migrations).

### Vector DB

| Name                  | Level | Notes                            |
| --------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| Milvus (Zilliz Cloud) | B     | First Vector DB used in LLM work |
| Pinecone              | B     | Planning to try serverless       |

I have production experience only with Milvus (Zilliz Cloud). Provisioning was handled by another member; I have not yet introduced a Vector DB from scratch myself.

### DevOps (including IaC)

| Name           | Level | Notes                                  |
| -------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| Terraform      | S     | Frequently used for AWS infrastructure |
| GitHub Actions | S     | Often used for CI/CD                   |

AI ops focus: dataset/versioning, prompt/version control, cost/latency monitoring, evaluation harnesses (offline/online), safety checks.

With public clouds like AWS, I commonly manage infra using Terraform. I have used Kubernetes for microservices efforts. For CI/CD, I currently prefer GitHub Actions to increase deploy frequency and shorten time-to-value.

### Public Cloud (AWS)

AWS services I have used:

I omit basics like VPC/CloudWatch. I have built entire infrastructures from scratch (incl. web apps) with AWS since around 2019.

# Technologies I'm Currently Interested In

## LLM

I actively use search AIs like Perplexity and AI-assisted IDEs like Cursor to improve productivity. I have a strong interest in LLM-backed app development; I began taking on such projects around July 2022.

I’m particularly interested in real-time APIs like OpenAI Realtime API and Gemini 2.0 Multimodal Live API. The latter enables pseudo video-calls with AI and feels very promising.

https://github.com/tetratensor/realtime-api-web-console

## Next.js

I first used Next.js around 2017, and became especially interested with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration). ISR can significantly improve response times for many services I work on.

Since Next.js 13, App Router with React Server Components is stable, making it even more important.

When Vercel is not an option, infra and ops costs rise, so I consider simpler frameworks like [Remix](https://remix.run).

## Edge Computing

With [Next.js Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/middleware) and [Remix](https://remix.run/), edge computing enables faster frontends and scenarios like A/B testing. I see code portability to non-Node runtimes (e.g., Vercel Edge Runtime) as increasingly necessary. Thus I watch lightweight frameworks like [Hono](https://hono.dev/).

## Cloudflare

Cloudflare now offers not only CDN/DDoS protection but also high-performance serverless (Workers) and a production DB (D1). I expect usage as an AWS alternative to increase.

An article I watch closely:

https://blog.cloudflare.com/python-workers

Python is officially supported on Cloudflare Workers, further improving synergy with AI apps. With WASI gaining traction as a post-container trend, Cloudflare’s support there is also interesting.

## React Server Components

With Next.js 13.4, App Router became stable and React Server Components are available:

https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4

In practice, shipped JS sizes are much smaller, opening opportunities to drastically improve page speed even for dynamic content. I am actively incorporating RSC into app design.

## Supabase

An affordable auth foundation with PostgreSQL and a Tokyo region, making it practical latency-wise.

Rapid auth plus PostgreSQL makes it my first-choice auth platform in many cases.
